Apache Daffodil (incubating) is the open source implementation of the Data
Format Description Language (DFDL), a specification created by the Open Grid

binary, commercial record-oriented, scientific and numeric, modern and legacy,
and many industry standards. It leverages XML technology and concepts, using a
subset of W3C XML schema type system and annotations to describe such data.
Daffodil uses this description to parse data into an XML infoset for ingestion
and validation.
