      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
     #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
     #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
     #
     #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
     #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
     #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
     #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
     #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
     #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
     #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
     #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
     #
     #  NO WARRANTY
     #
     #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
     #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
     #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
     #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
     #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
     #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
     #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
     #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
     #  any right of any third party.
     #
     #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
     #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
     #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
     #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
     #
     #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
     #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
     #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
     #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
     #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
     #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
     #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
     #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
     #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
     #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
     #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
     #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
     #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
     #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
     #  production of secondary products from the program.
     #
     #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
     #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
     #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
     #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
     #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
     #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
     #  above as far as the program is concerned.

    5. Time Zone Database

      ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
    Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
    is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
    Database section 7.

     # 7.  Database Ownership
     #
     #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
     #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
     #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
     #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
     #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
     #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
     #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
     #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
     #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
     #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
     #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
     #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
     #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
        its Contributions.

    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

    2.4. Subsequent Licenses

    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

    2.5. Representation

    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

    2.6. Fair Use

    2.7. Conditions

    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
    in Section 2.1.

    3. Responsibilities
    -------------------

    3.1. Distribution of Source Form

    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
    Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
    attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form.

    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
        Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
        the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
        Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
        than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

    (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
        the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
    Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
    Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
    License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
    Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
    License(s).

    3.4. Notices

    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

    3.5. Application of Additional Terms

    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
    Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
    behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
    such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
    liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
    indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
    jurisdiction.

    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
    ---------------------------------------------------

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
    License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
    statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
    the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
    describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
    be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
    Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
    or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

    5. Termination
    --------------

    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
    first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
    from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
    Your receipt of the notice.

    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
    You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
    2.1 of this License shall terminate.

    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
    prior to termination shall survive termination.

    8. Litigation
    -------------

    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
    courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
    Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
    cross-claims or counter-claims.

    9. Miscellaneous
    ----------------

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
    that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
    shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

    10. Versions of the License
    ---------------------------

    10.1. New Versions

    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
    10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
    publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
    distinguishing version number.

    10.2. Effect of New Versions

    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
    of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
    or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
    steward.

    10.3. Modified Versions

    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
    create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
    modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
    any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
    such modified license differs from this License).

    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
    Licenses

    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
    Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
    notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

    Saxon contains subcomponents with separate copyright notices:

      It is provided "as is" without expressed or implied warranty.


      (This notice is included in the Saxon distribution because Saxon

      in the version distributed with Saxon is the removal of code that Saxon does not need.)

      (This notice is included in the Saxon distribution because Saxon 
      uses code for conversion of XML Schema Regular expressions to 
      Java/.NET regular expressions that was originally written by James
      Clark and made available under this license. The Saxon version of
      the code has been enhanced in various ways but is still recognizably
      based on the original.)
