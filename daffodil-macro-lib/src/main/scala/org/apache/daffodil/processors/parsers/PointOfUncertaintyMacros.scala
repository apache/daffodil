  /**
   * For creating a point of uncertainty and ensuring that it is cleaned up

   * create and use points of uncertainties, while avoiding allocating
   * functions. Thus, this allows something like this:
   *
   *   pstate.withPointOfUncertainty { pou =>
   *     // code that implements parsing, and may potentially reset to,
   *     // discard, or resolve this pou variable
   *   }
   *
   * Upon completion of the block, if the new point of uncertainty has not been
   * discarded, reset to, or resovled, this pou will then be discarded,
   * ensuring that Marks are always cleaned up appropriately.
