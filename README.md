Apache Daffodil is an open-source implementation of the [DFDL
specification] that uses DFDL data descriptions to parse fixed format
data into an infoset.  This infoset is commonly converted into XML or
JSON to enable the use of well-established XML or JSON technologies
and libraries to consume, inspect, and manipulate fixed format data in
existing solutions.  Daffodil is also capable of serializing or
"unparsing" data back to the original data format.  The DFDL infoset
can also be converted directly to/from the data structures carried by
data processing frameworks so as to bypass any XML/JSON overheads.

For more information about Daffodil, see <https://daffodil.apache.org/>.

## Build Requirements

* JDK 8 or higher
* SBT 0.13.8 or higher
* C compiler C99 or higher
* Mini-XML Version 3.2 or higher

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for more details.

## Getting Started

[SBT] is the officially supported tool to build Daffodil.  Below are
some of the more commonly used commands for Daffodil development.

### Compile

Compile source code:

    sbt compile

### Tests

Run unit tests:

    sbt test

Run command line interface tests:

    sbt IntegrationTest/test

### Command Line Interface

Build the command line interface (Linux and Windows shell scripts in
`daffodil-cli/target/universal/stage/bin/`; see the [Command Line
Interface] documentation for details on their usage):

    sbt daffodil-cli/stage

### License Check

Run [Apache RAT] (license audit report in `target/rat.txt` and error
if any unapproved licenses are found):

    sbt ratCheck

### Test Coverage Report

Run [sbt-scoverage] (report in `target/scala-ver/scoverage-report/`):

    sbt clean coverage test IntegrationTest/test
    sbt coverageAggregate
