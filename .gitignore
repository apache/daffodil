# This is a bit odd. These files for the patterns below
# don't exist in the file system
# but eclipse has its own kind of internal resource links to them
# and when EGit (eclipse's git interface) looks for files to say, commit
# it constructs paths using its own resource links, and then 
# uses .gitignore to work out the ones it isn't to use.
# so this helps with using git from eclipse.
#
# The eclipse-projects directories are supposed to just be 
# eclipse project .project and .classpath files as far as
# git is concerned. However, they will have src folders
# if they are split into main and unittest projects.
