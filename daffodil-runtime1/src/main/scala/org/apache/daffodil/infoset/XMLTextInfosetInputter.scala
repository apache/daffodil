  /**
   * Read an event from an XMLStreamReader and write the same event to an
   * XMLStreamWriter. For example, this can be used for convert XML from one
   * type of input to a different type (e.g. InputStream to String), check for
   * well-formed XML, and perform some basic normalization. Example usage of
   * this function is to call this in a loop like this:
   *
   *   while (xsr.hasNext()) {
   *     xsr.next()
   *     XMLTextInfoset.writeStreamEvent(xsr, xsw)
   *   }
   *
   * This approach allows callers to skip certain events by conditionally
   * calling this function.
   *
   * It is assumed that the caller calls xsw.startDocument() if needed. This
   * function does not handle the START_DOCUMENT event.
   *
   * Because we disable coalescing in our XMLStreamReader, we will actually get
   * events for CHARACTERS, CDATA, SPACE, and ENTITY_REFERENCE, which would
   * otherwise be lost. This allows us to convert XML to strings (e.g. in
   * gatherXmlAsString) that are much closer to the original XML, and in some
   * cases exactly the same.
   *
   * This function drops all DTD events. This is because this function is used
   * to either embed XML into the middle of an XML infoset, or read an embedded
   * XML from the middle of an XML infoset. In either case DTD's aren't allowed
   * because they are only allowed at the top of XML, and so we drop them.
   *
   * Spaces inside element tags (e.g. in between attributes/namespce
   * declarations) are not preserved.
   *
   * Attribute and namespace definitions order is preserved, but all namespace
   * definitions are output first followed by all attributes.
   *
   * Element/attribute prefixes are preserved
   *
   * Comments are preserved
   *
   * CDATA regions are preserved
   *
   * Processing instructions are preserved.
   *
   * The XML declaration is always output when unparsing, and never output when
   * parsing (handled by the callers).
   *
   * Double quotes are always used for attribute/namespace definitions, except
   * in the XML declaration which always uses single quotes.
   *
   * The following character entities are preserved: &lt; &amp; &#xd;. The
   * decimal entitity &#10; is converted to the &#xd; hex entity. All others
   * are converted to thir UTF-8 characters. Because DTD is disabled, custom
   * entities are not supported and result in an error.
   *
   * Whitespace, both inbetween complex elements and inside simple elements, are
   * preserved. However, whitespace in the epilog or prolog is ignored.
   *
   * Elements with no content but with an open and close tag are converted to a
   * an empty-element tag.
   *
   * Both a lone CR and CRLF are converted to LF.
