   * stack. Each time we want to descend into a child element (via a call to
   * next()) we get the next node from _2 on the top of the stack, and then push
   * a tuple of that element and its children to the top of the stack. When a
   * child iterator.hasNext is false, that means we have visited all the
   * children and we should do a end event for the current element at the top
   * of the stack. The doStartEvent variable defined below helps to keep track
   * if we should do a start or end event for the element at the top of the
   * stack. Note that null at the top of the stack is used to signify the
   * Start/EndDocument events. All other items on the stack should be an
   * Element.
