   *
   * An example would be dfdl:emptyValueDelimiterPolicy="both" dfdl:initiator='"' dfdl:terminator='"'.
   * Then in comma separated data, if you want to specify that a field contains an empty string,
   * the data must contain ....,"",.... i.e., open-close quotes to indicate a literal empty string.
   *
   * The EmptyRep for simpleTypes enables default values to be substituted at parse time.
   *
   * For simple types xs:string and xs:hexBinary, the property dfdlx:emptyElementParsePolicy controls
   * whether the EmptyRep is allowed for strings and hexBinary. In required positions, when
   * dfdlx:emptyElementParsePolicy is 'treatAsMissing', a required string/hexBinary that has EmptyRep
   * causes a Parse Error, and an optional EmptyRep causes nothing to be added to the infoset (the empty string
   * or hexBinary value is suppressed). When dfdlx:emptyElementParsePolicy is 'treatAsEmpty', a required
   * string/hexBinary with EmptyRep creates an empty string or zero-length byte array in the infoset.
   * An optional EmptyRep behaves differently depending on whether the EmptyRep is truly zero-length, or
   * dfdl:emptyValueDelimiterPolicy is such that EmptyRep is non-zero-length. When truly zero-length, no
   * value is added to the infoset. When non-zero-length, an empty string or zero-length byte array is added
   * to the infoset at the current index.
   *
   * An element may have no EmptyRep. For example, a fixed-length data element has no EmptyRep.
   *
   * An element of complex type can have EmptyRep, but dfdl:emptyValueDelimiterPolicy does not apply.
   * TBD: CONFIRM THIS. When a complex type element is parsed, and zero data is consumed, but the parse is successful,
   * then any infoset created is the "empty value" for this complex type element. When the element is required,
   * this infoset is retained. When the element is optional, this infoset is discarded, any side-effects that occurred
