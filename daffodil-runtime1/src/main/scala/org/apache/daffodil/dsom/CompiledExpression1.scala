 * AND everything was computed lazily, then this would probably all
 * just sort itself out and not be circular. What makes the circularity
 * is that the runtime data structures (ElementRuntimeData in particular),
 * are not lazy. Everything part of them is forced to be evaluated when those are
 * constructed. So anything that needs even one member of an ERD
 * is artificially dependent on *everything* in the ERD.
 *
 * Similarly these DPath compiler data structures.... anything that depends on them
 * is artificially dependent on ALL of their members's values.
 *
 * So the separation of DPath compiler info from runtime data structures is
 * really as close as we get in Daffodil to organizing the compilation of schemas
 * into "passes".
