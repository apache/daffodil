# PLEASE NOTE:
#
# These are in src/test/resources not src/main/resources because they're not
# "real" in the sense of being fully featured. E.g., AIS only does the payload
# armoring, not everything else about AIS. IPv4 just does the IPv4 header, not
# TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc. all of which have related checksum algorithms that should
# share code. A real CheckDigits has to have different layer length kinds supported
# so that one can compute check digits from elements with different
# of length kinds.
#
# These are partial/subsets of "real" functionality that give us test coverage
# of the layering features of Daffodil. They can be reused to create "real"
# layering, but one should expect to have to adapt their code substantially.
