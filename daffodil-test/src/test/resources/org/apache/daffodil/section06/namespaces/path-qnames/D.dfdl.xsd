<!-- Via the include, we get in this target namespace the elements defined in C.dfdl.xsd
However, that schema's element's form are respected so when C.dfdl.xsd specifies elementFormDefault qualified,
that takes precedence over the elementFormDefault here. Similarly when C.dfdl.xsd specifies a local element
declaration with form="qualified" that is interpreted as if that element decl were within this schema,
which means it will have this target namespace qualifying its name.  -->
