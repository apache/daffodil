  Negative test. Should include information that we searched in testData_onClassPath/childDir
  becasue that is NOT a directory on the class path, but searched it because that was where the 
  file doing the include (that failed) is located, and self-relative is also searched.
  
  However, unclear how to check this in an error message. Just testData_onClassPath/childDir
  won't do it because that will be mentioned in the path of the file having the error.
  
  Perhaps that is sufficient.
