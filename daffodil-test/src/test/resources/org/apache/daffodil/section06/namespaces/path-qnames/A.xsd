	<!-- Summary: In xpath expressions, xmlns is not considered. An identifier
	that has no prefix is always interpreted as a local (unqualified) child of whatever it's parent is. It is never
	augmented by an xmlns default namespace.
	
	This is not entirely consistent with the way the ref attribute works. There, an xmlns declaration is utilized.
	
	However, the scenarios aren't quite the same. In a ref attribute, we are only referencing global objects
	so we only need a prefix, or a default namespace to make clear what global object we are referencing.
	
	In an xpath the names are relative path children of whatever is 
	above them. Those children are either qualified or unqualified. If they were unqualified, and the xpath were to a 
	context where there is a default xmlns definition, then there would be no way to reference the unqualified
	child element AT ALL. But, if the default xmlns definition is ignored, one can use a prefix to make clear what 
	qualified name one is referencing, and no prefix to refer to local elements that are unqualified.
	
	Hence, the name of a local element declaration is a bit different from the name of a global element, 
	and a named path step in an XPath is a bit different from a ref to a global element. 
	
	The system for dealing with all this:
	
	QNameBase - common to all varieties - contains a prefix (optional), a local name, and a namespace(optional)
	
	NamedQName - QNames that name things
	There are global object names (for group defs, type defs, element decls, ...) - GlobalQName
	There are local element names (for child elements within a model group) - LocalDeclQName
	
	RefQNameBase - QNames that refer to named things
	There are reference to global names - RefQName - refers to a GlobalQName
	There are references to local names - StepQName - refers to a child element. 
	
	A StepQName can be a reference to a global name if the 
	child element was created using an element reference. 
	A StepQName is a reference to a local name if the child element was created 
	using a local element declaration. 
	
	QName - Factory for QNames
	createGlobal - creates a GlobalQName - requires a local name part, and a target namespace
	
	createLocal - creates a LocalDeclQName 
	- requires a local namespace, whether the name is qualfied or not, a targetNamespace
	(used if the name is qualified, ignored otherwise), and a scope - which can be used to warn
	1) if the target namespace has no prefix associated with it
	2) if there is no target namespace, but qualified is requested
	3) if there is an xmlns default namespace definition, the name is unqualified, and the target namespace
	doesn't match the default namespace
		
	resolveRef - creates a RefQName - used for element ref, group ref, type ref (the type="..." syntax)
	resolveStep - creates a StepQName - used for steps of path expressions.
	
	In both cases you need a QName and a scope for resolving prefixes. However, the scope is used differently for
	resolveStep. In this case if the QName has no prefix then any default namespace is not used. (A warning in this case
	is sensible, as an author may think they are referencing a qualified name based on xmlns default namespace.)
	For resolveRef, if the QName has no prefix then xmlns WILL be used if defined, and if it is not defined, 
	then the referenced global object must be in a schema that has no target namespace.
	
	The elementFormDefault behaves as if you took every local element decl and added a form="..." attribute to it.
	For every local element decl lexically enclosed in this schema. If that schema is subsequently included into 
	another, the element names are still qualified or unqualified based on the schema where they lexically appeared.
