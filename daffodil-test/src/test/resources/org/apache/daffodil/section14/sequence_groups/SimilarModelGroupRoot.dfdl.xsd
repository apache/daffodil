<!--
  This schema contains references to two completely different elements
  (simpleElement1 and simpleElement2), which are exactly the same (including
  line numbers) except for the root elements and a sibling element. This schema
  is used to test that even though these schemas are very similar (particularly
  the choice with dispatch) and do have some object equality, because they are
  in different XML files they should not have reference equality and dsom
  elements will not be shared.
