  Note: Bug DAFFODIL-2339

  We'd like to have these schemaLocation attributes on daf:dfdlConfig, but this breaks tests because
  it tries to load the schema from the schemaLocation, and can't resolve org/apache/daffodil/xsd/dafext.xsd.

  Simple things like adding an sbt dependency from daffodil-cli back to daffodil-lib, whether always or "it->test"
  dependent, don't fix this.

  The CLI is using DaffodilXMLLoader to load this config file, so the resolver should be doing the right thing by
  finding this dafext.xsd on the class path inside of daffodil-lib's jar.

  The failure seems to happen earlier. A SAX fatal error is invoked when looking up dfdl:anyOther a symbol
  in the dfdl schema annotation schemas, from the XMLSchema_for_DFDL.
