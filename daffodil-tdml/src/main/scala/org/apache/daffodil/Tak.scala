/**
 * Tak is about establishing a sort-of platform independent self-calibrating
 * unit of comparison, which is how fast the JVM implements a 3 argument
 * function call.
 *
 * A unit, called a takeon, or scala takeon because these are language
 * specific, is the number of nanoseconds per 3-argument java function call.
 *
 * The function tak(a, b, c), does not build a deep stack,
 * uses no heap allocation, and never creates a large number.
 * It can be setup to run for billions of calls using only 3 small integer values.
 * All the calls are 3-arguments, passing Scala Int type.
