/**
 * Prior to Java 16, the java.util.zip.GZIPOutputStream wrote a value of zero for
 * the OS field in the header (byte index 9). In Java 16, this was changed to a
 * value of 255 to better abide by the GZIP specification. Unfortunately, this
 * means unparsed data using a GZIP layer might have a single byte difference,
 * depending on the Java version used. This can lead to inconsistent behavior of
 * test failures that expect a certain byte value.
 *
 * To resolve this issue, we create this GZIPFixedOutputStream. This should wrap
 * the underlying OutputStream and be passed as the OutputStream to the
 * GZIPOutputStream. When the GZIPOutputStream writes the 9th byte to this
 * GZIPFixedOutputStream, this will always write a value of 255, making all Java
 * versions prior to 16 consistent with Java 16+ behavior.
