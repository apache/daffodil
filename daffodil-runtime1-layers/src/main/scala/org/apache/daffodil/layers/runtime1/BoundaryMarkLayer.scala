/**
 * A layer which isolates text data by way of a boundary mark string.
 * This is like a terminating delimiter of a DFDL element or sequence/choice group,
 * except that there is no escaping mechanism, so the data cannot in any way
 * contain the boundary mark string, and elements within the layer can have
 * any dfdl:lengthKind, but this does not affect the search for the boundary mark.
 *
 * For example, when using an element with dfdl:lengthKind="delimited" and a dfdl:terminator="END",
 * if that element contains a child element with dfdl:lengthKind="explicit", then the
 * search for the "END" terminator is suspended for the length of the child element, and
 * that search resumes after the child element's length has been parsed.
 *
 * In contrast to this, if a boundary mark layer is used with the boundaryMark variable
 * bound to "END", then the data stream is decoded as characters in the charset encoding
 * given by the layerEncoding variable, and the layer continues until the "END" is found.
 * The dfdl:lengthKind of any child element enclosed within the layer, or even the lengths
 * of other layers found within the scope of this boundary mark layer are not considered and do not
 * disrupt the search for the boundary mark string.
 *
 * This layer does not populate any DFDL variables with results.
 *
 * This layer defines two DFDL variables which provide required parameters.
