  <!-- With lengthKind="delimited", tests show various ways to in indicate
    the end of an element's content - with terminator, with
    parent separator, with parent of specified length, with end of input.
    Delimited length can also be used with BCD fields, which
    is shown here. Also, an element of explicit length can be a component
    of a delimited sequence. -->
