  // AM is a MIME style example
  // Wasn't working for lack of occursCountKind, and
  // because the bytes were flipped. It was written assuming that
  // Hex like A1B2 was interpreted as little endian words. I.e, the first
  // byte in that would be B2.
  // That's not how TDML works anyway. A1 is first. So by swizzling the indexes
  // the tests were asking for. Voila, they work.
  //
  // NOTE: AM.dfdl.xsd isn't a valid schema because it has an array in a hidden
  // group. Because everything inside a hidden group must be either default or
  // OVC, and arrays can't have either, they cannot be in hidden groups. It is
  // not worth fixing this test to work at the moment.
