/**
 * There is an asymmetry between DataInputStream and DataOutputStream with respect to the
 * positions and limits in the bit stream.
 *
 * For the DataInputStream, we have this concept of the current bitPos0b,
 * and optionally there may be abound called bitLimit0b. There are 1b
 * variants of these.
 *
 * For parsing, these are always absolute values, that is they contain bit
 * position relative the ultimate start of the input stream where parsing
 * began.
 *
 * For DataOutputStream, we have slightly different concepts.
 *
 * There are absolute and relative variants. The absolute bitPosOb or
 * absBitPos0b is symmetric to the parser's bitPos0b. It's the position
 * relative to the ultimate start of the output stream.
 *
 * However, we often do not know this value. So the UState and
 * DataOutputStream have a maybeAbsBitPos0b which can be MaybeULong.Nope if
 * the value isn't known.
 *
 * In addition we have the relative or relBitPos0b. This is relative to the
 * start of whatever buffer we are doing unparsing into.
 *
 * When unparsing, we often have to unparse into a buffer where the
 * ultimate actual absolute position isn't yet known, but we have to do the
 * unparsing anyway, for example so that we can measure exactly how long
 * something is.
 *
 * Conversely, sometimes we simply must have the absolute output bit
 * position, for example, when computing the number of bits to insert to
 * achieve the required alignment.
 *
 * Hence we have relBitPos0b - always known and is a value >= 0, and we
 * have maybeAbsBitPos0b which is a MaybeULong. If known it is >=0.
 *
 * Corresponding to bit position we have bit limit, which is measured in
 * the same 0b or 1b units, but is *always* a maybe type, because even in
 * the case where we know the absolute position, we still may or may not
 * have any limit in place. Hence the UState and DataOutputStream have a
 *
 * maybeRelBitLimit0b
 *
 * and
 *
 * maybeAbsBitLimit0b.
 *
 * One invariant is this: when the absolute bit pos is known, then it is
 * the same as the relative bit pos. Similarly when the absolute bit limit
 * is known, then the relative bit limit is known and is equal.
 *
