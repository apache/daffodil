/**
 * To support dfdl:outputValueCalc, we must suspend output. This is done by
 * taking the current "direct" output, and splitting it into a still direct part, and
 * a following buffered output.
 *
 * The direct part waits for the OVC calculation to complete, when that is written,
 * it is finished and collapses into the following, which was buffered, but becomes direct
 * as a result of this collapsing.
 *
 * Hence, most output will be to direct data output streams, with some, while an OVC
 * is pending, will be buffered, but this is eliminated as soon as possible.
 *
 * A Buffered DOS can be finished or not. Not finished means that it might still be
 * appended to. Not concurrently, but by other code invoked from this thread of
 * control (which might traverse different co-routine "stack" threads, but it's still
 * one thread of control).
 *
 * Finished means that the Buffered DOS can never be appended to again.
 *
 * Has two modes of operation, buffering or direct. When buffering, all output goes into a
 * buffer. When direct, all output goes into a "real" DataOutputStream.
 *
 * The isLayer parameter defines whether or not this instance originated from a
 * layer or not. This is important to specify because this class is reponsible
 * for closing the associated Java OutputStream, ultimately being written to
 * the underlying underlying DataOutputStream. However, if the DataOutputStream
 * is not related to a layer, that means the associated Java OutputStream came
 * from the user and it is the users responsibility to close it. The isLayer
 * provides the flag to know which streams should be closed or not.
 *
 * chunkSizeInBytes is used when the buffered output stream is using a file as
 * its buffer. This is the size of chunks that will be read into memory before
 * being written to the direct output stream.
 *
 * maxBufferSizeInByte is the size that the ByteArrayOutputStream will grow to
 * before switching over to a FileOutputStream
 *
 * tempDirPath is the path where temporary files will be created when switching
 * to a file based buffer
 *
 * maybeExistingFile is used in the case of blob files, where we already have an
 * existing file containing the data. This is the path to said file.
