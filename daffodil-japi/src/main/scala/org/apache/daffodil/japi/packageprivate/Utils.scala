// generation has no concept of package private. So if there is anything that
// should be package private and thus not part of the public API (e.g.
// utilities for converting from Scala to Java), there isn't a way to exclude
// them from Javadocs. So, when we generate Javadocs, we manually exclude
// anything in the japiexclude package. So anything that should be package
// private should go in this package.
