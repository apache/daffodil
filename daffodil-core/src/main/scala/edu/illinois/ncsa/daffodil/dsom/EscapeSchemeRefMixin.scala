   * Changed to use findProperty, and to resolve the namespace properly.
   *
   * We lookup a property like escapeSchemeRef, and that actual property
   * binding can be local, in scope, by way of a format reference, etc.
   *
   * It's value is a QName, and the definition of the prefix is from the
   * location where we found the property, and NOT where we consume the property.
   *
   * Hence, we resolve w.r.t. the location that provided the property.
   *
   * The point of findProperty vs. getProperty is just that the former returns
   * both the value, and the object that contained it. That object is what
   * we resolve QNames with respect to.
   *
   * Note: Same is needed for properties that have expressions as their values.
   * E.g., consider "{ ../foo:bar/.. }". That foo prefix must be resolved relative
   * to the object where this property was written, not where it is evaluated. (JIRA
   * issue DFDL-77)
