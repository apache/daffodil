/**
 * Handle and unparse XMLReader SAX events using a provided DataProcessor and
 * OutputChannel
 *
 * Note: XMLReaders using this as their ContentHandler must have support for XML
 * namespaces so that we provided namespace URI and prefix information that Daffodil
 * requires to unparse.
 *
 * The SAX ContentHandler API is push-based, but the Daffodil InfosetInputter unparse
 * API is pull-based, so these two API's are at odds with one another. To link the
 * two, we create two classes that implement a coroutine-like API to communicate and
 * ensure that the push and pull sides of the two APIs never run at the same time
 * (see Coroutine.scala for implementation details). The main coroutine or "event
 * queuer" is this DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl and runs on the same thread as
 * an XMLReader to handle and batch SAX events. The worker coroutine or "event
 * puller" is an instance of the SAXInfosetInputter which calls the actual unparse()
 * function to query these batched SAX events and unparse data.
 *
 * Below is a description of how this class is used and they communicate to unparse
 * using the SAX XMLReader API:
 *
 * 1. A DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl instance is created, which initializes a
 *    SAXInfosetInputter instance.
 *
 * 2. An XMLReader instance is created and configured to use the
 *    DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl to handle its SAX events.
 *
 * 3. The DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl handles events from the XMLReader,
 *    gathers the necessary information from those events, and fills out an array of
 *    SAXInfosetEvent objects, called a "batch".
 *
 * 4. When a full batch has been gathered, or an endDocument() event is handled, the
 *    DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl calls resume() to pause execution and start
 *    the SAXInfosetInputter coroutine, sending it the batch of events.
 *
 * 5. Since this is the first time the SAXInfosetInputter has been given control, its
 *    coroutine Thread is started and its run() function called. This calls
 *    waitResume() to receive the first batch of events. It then calls the
 *    DataProcessor unparse() function to begin the unparse.
 *
 * 6. The SAXInfosetInputter functions are called by the unparse, which reads the
 *    batched events and provides the necessary information to unparse the infoset.
 *    Once the SAXInfosetInputter has unparsed all batched events and needs a new
 *    event in the next() function, it calls resume() to pause execution and resume
 *    the DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl coroutine, sending it Nope to signify it
 *    needs more events.
 *
 * 7. The DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl resumes and again continues to handle SAX
 *    events and fill out the batched events array until it is full or endDocument()
 *    is handled, at which point it calls resume() to pause and send the new batch of
 *    events to the SAXInfosetInputter where it resumes control.
 *
 * 8. Steps 6 and 7 repeat until the SAXInfosetInputter signals back to the
 *    DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl that it is complete calling resumeFinal() and
 *    sending a One object containing either an UnparseResult or an Exception. At
 *    this point, the SAXInfosetInputter is complete and provide control back to the
 *    DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl--the SAXInfosetInputter coroutine is done.
 *
 * 9. The DaffodilUnparseContentHandlerImpl resumes, recieves and examines the result
 *    from the SAXInfosetInputter, and either makes the UnparseResult available to
 *    the XMLReader or throws a SAXException if there was an error.
 *
 * @param dp DataProcessor object that will be used to start the unparse
 * @param output OutputChannel of where the unparsed data is written
