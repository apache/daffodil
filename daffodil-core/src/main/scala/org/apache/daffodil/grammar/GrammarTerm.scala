/**
 * Gram - short for "Grammar Term"
 *
 * These are the objects in the grammar.
 *
 * This grammar really differs a great deal from what we find in the DFDL specification
 * because it actually has to be operationalized.
 *
 * Many of the grammar productions really aren't terribly grammar-like
 * in appearance, because the conditional logic overwhelms the aspects that look
 * like grammar productions.
 *
 * Another way to think of this as it's just the "second tree".
 * Daffodil starts by creating the DSOM "first tree"
 * which is just the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the DFDL language. Then by way of compiling creates
 * this Gram tree from that which enables a variety of optimizations based on a simple rules-with-guards idiom.
 *
 * This Gram tree is then a generator of a Parser and an Unparser which incorporate both
 * the parsing/unparsing logic and all RuntimeData structures in their members. If something completely optimizes out
 * then it becomes the EmptyGram which other Gram combinators recognize and optimize out.
