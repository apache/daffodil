/**
 * Prod or Grammar Production
 *
 * Note the call by name on the GramArg. We don't evaluate the GramArg at all unless the guard is true.
 *
 * Guards are used so we can have grammars that include all possibilities,
 * but where examining the format properties specifically would indicate that some of those
 * possibilities are precluded. The guard causes that term to just splice itself out
 * of the grammar.
 *
 * Note that it is crucial that the guardArg is passed by value, and the gramArg is
 * passed by name.
 *
 * Prod objects are not required. They essentially provide some useful debug capability
 * because a grammar term object will display as it's name, not as some anonymous object.
