/*
 * This and related classes implement so called "line folding" from
 * IETF RFC 2822 Internet Message Format (IMF), and IETF RFC 5545 iCalendar.
 *
 * There are multiple varieties of line folding, and it is important to
 * be specific about which algorithm.
 *
 * For IMF, unfolding simply removes CRLFs if they are followed by a space or tab.
 * The Folding is more complex however, as CRLFs can only be inserted before
 * a space/tab that appears in the data. If the data has no spaces, then no
 * folding is possible.
 * If there are spaces/tabs, the one closest to position 78 is used unless it is
 * followed by punctuation, in which case a prior space/tab (if it exists) is used.
 * (This preference for spaces not followed by punctuation is optional, it is
 * not required, but is preferred in the IMF RFC.)
 *
 * Note: folding is done by some systems in a manner that does not respect
 * character boundaries - i.e., in utf-8, a multi-byte character sequence may be
 * broken in the middle by insertion of a CRLF. Hence, unfolding initially treats
 * the text as iso-8859-1, i.e., just bytes, and removes CRLFs, then subsequently
 * re-interprets the bytes as the expected charset such as utf-8.
 *
 * IMF is supposed to be US-ASCII, but implementations have gone to 8-bit characters
 * being preserved, so the above problem can occur.
 *
 * IMF has a maximum line length of 998 characters per line excluding the CRLF.
 * The layer should fail (cause a parse error) if a line longer than this is encountered
 * or constructed after unfolding. When unparsing, if a line longer than 998 cannot be
 * folded due to no spaces/tabs being present in it, then it is an unparse error.
 *
 * Note that i/vCalendar, vCard, and MIME payloads held by IMF do not run into
 * the IMF line length issues, in that they have their own line length limits that
 * are smaller than those of IMF, and which do not require accommodation by having
 * pre-existing spaces/tabs in the data. So such data *always* will be short
 * enough lines.
 *
 * For vCard, iCalendar, and vCalendar, the maximum is 75 bytes plus the CRLF, for
 * a total of 77. Folding is inserted by inserting CRLF + a space or tab. The
 * CRLF and the following space or tab are removed to unfold. If data happened to
 * contain a CRLF followed by a space or tab initially, then that will be lost when
 * the data is parsed.
 *
 * For MIME, the maximum line length is 76.
 *
 * This layer would normally be used in a context of either an enclosing element
 * which bounds its length (dfdl:lengthKind 'explicit', 'prefixed', or 'pattern')
 * or an enclosing layer that bounds its length (ex: boundaryMark).
 *
 * This layer can interact badly with surrounding elements of dfdl:lengthKind 'pattern'
 * if the pattern is, for example ".*?\\r\\n(?!(?:\\t|\\ ))" which is anything up to
 * and including a CRLF not followed by a space or tab. The problem is that this layer
 * converts isolated \n or \r into \r\n, and if this just happens to be followed by a
 * non space/tab character this will have inserted an end-of-data in the middle of the
 * data.
