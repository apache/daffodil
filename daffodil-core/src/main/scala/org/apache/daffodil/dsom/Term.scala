  // E.g., the prior sibling in this sequence might satisfy, or the enclosing parent if we're
  // first, or the prior sibling of the enclosing parent, or the last child of the prior
  // sibling of the enclosing parent, and so on.
  //
  // Really we often need the "things before this" enumerated and filtered, so there
  // should be a stream of things looking at prior prior of that, prior of that, etc.
  //
  // Choice groups require special consideration. A prior that's a choice only has a
  // defined property if (1) it's relevant to the choice group - so dfdl:terminator yes, dfdl:byteOrder no.
  // (2) it is present for that choice group, or (3) it is recursively present on the last of
  // ALL children of the choice group, so that it is present with a specific value no matter
  // which branch of the choice is realized.
  //
  // It is ok for this to stop early and be less comprehensive about walking backward
  // IFF it is used in conservative analysis, i.e., where not finding the term, even if
  // it does in fact exist back there someplace, causes no incorrectness, just suboptimality.
  //
  // Note also that the predicate test interacts with sequence groups in a complex way.
  // If the sequence group has separators, the separator will be present (because the current
  // term is not first, or the sep is in prefix position, or ...) then if the predicate
  // is true of a sequence separator (e.g., such as has same encoding property value) then
  // we have a preceding physical term, the enclosing sequence, which has a physical
  // syntax, the separator, which satisfies the predicate.
  //
  // That's the job of the predicate. The point is that this predicate may or may not
  // stop on some enclosing parent, depending on separators, etc. You can't just have the
  // predicate be "has same encoding" test, because whether that encoding will have been
  // put into effect depends on whether some group syntax - such as a separator, or initiator
  // will have been present and so required establishing that property to be in effect.
  //
  // If a sequence has no separator and no initiator, then it doesn't impose an encoding prior to or
  // between the sibling children. Hence, even if it has an encoding property in scope, and even
  // uses it for a terminator, it doesn't re-establish that encoding prior to children, so
  // the analysis can't stop on the sequence.
