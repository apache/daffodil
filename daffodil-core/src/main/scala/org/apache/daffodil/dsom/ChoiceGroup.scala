/**
 *
 * Captures concepts common to all choice definitions, which includes both
 * local and global choice definitions, but not choice group references.
 *
 * Choices are a bit complicated.
 *
 * They can have initiators and terminators. This is most easily thought of as wrapping each choice
 * inside a sequence having only the choice inside it, and moving the initiator and terminator specification to that
 * sequence.
 *
 * That sequence is then the term replacing the choice wherever the choice is.
 *
 * Choices can have children which are scalar elements. In this case, that scalar element behaves as if it were
 * a child of the enclosing sequence (which could be the one we just injected above the choice.
 *
 * Choices can have children which are recurring elements. In this case, the behavior is as if the recurring child was
 * placed inside a sequence which has no initiator nor terminator, but repeats the separator specification from
 * the sequence context that encloses the choice.
 *
 * All that, and the complexities of separator suppression too.
 *
 * There's also issues like this:
 *
 * <choice>
 *    <element .../>
 *    <sequence/>
 * </choice>
 *
 * in the above, one alternative is an empty sequence. So this choice may produce an element which takes up
 * a child position, and potentially requires separation, or it may produce nothing at all.
 *

   * The DFDL Spec as of this writing 2015-06-02 says that branches cannot be optional, but then
   * specifies that what it means is that if a choice branch root is an element/element-ref, it
   * cannot have minOccurs="0". This is a different notion of optional.
   *
   * The DFDL Working group has Action 280 which is about whether this should be corrected/modified.
   * There are two notions of optionality in DFDL. First is optional meaning 0 or 1 occurrence of an
   * element. The second is "not required", and that is defined in terms of dfdl:occursCountKind.
   *
   * For the time being, the definition of non-optional used here is that is not minOccurs="0" if an
   * element, and that unless it is a calculated element, it must have some footprint syntactically
   * from the data value or framing.
   *
   * Open issues:
   * 1) Is alignment or leading/trailing skip to be considered syntax. Alignment might not be there.
   * 2) What about an empty sequence that only carries statement annotations such as dfdl:assert or
   * dfdl:setVariable
   *
   * This latter need to be allowed, because while they do not have known required syntax they do
   * have to be executed for side-effect.
