/**
 * This is the primary API class for writing layers.
 * <p>
 * All layers are derived from this class.
 * <p>
 * This class is used directly as a base class to define <i>transforming</i> layers.
 * To simplify the
 * definition of <i>checksum</i> layers, a specialized sub-class
 * {@link ChecksumLayer}
 * is also available.
 * Many of the requirements for layers, such as the naming conventions for layer variables,
 * are described here, but they apply equally to checksum layers.
 * <p>
 * Derived classes will be dynamically loaded by Java's Service Provider Interface (SPI) system.
 * The names of concrete classes derived from Layer are listed in
 * a metadata resource file
 * named for this class (that is, the file name is the fully-qualified class name of this class:
 * {@code resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.daffodil.runtime1.layers.api.Layer}).
 * This file contains lines where each line contains one fully qualified class name of a derived
 * layer class.
 * More than one line in the file denotes that the Jar file contains the definitions of more than one derived layer
 * class.
 * This file is incorporated in the compiled jar file for the derived {@code Layer} class
 * so that the class path can be searched and Jars containing layer classes can be dynamically loaded.
 * <p>
 * The SPI creates an instance the class by calling a default (no-arg) constructor, which should be
 * the only constructor.
 * <p>
 * Instances of derived layer classes can be stateful.
 * They are private to threads, and each time a layer
 * is encountered during parse/unparse, an instance is created for that situation.
 * <p>
 * Layer instances should not share mutable state (such as via singleton objects).
 * <p>
 * <h2>About Layer Variables</h2>
 * <p>
 * Layer logic may read and write DFDL variables.
 * These variables are associated with the layer implementation class by using
 * Java/Scala reflection to find matches (case-sensitive) between the names of DFDL variables and method
 * names and method arguments of the layer's Java/Scala code.
 * Hence, the layer's DFDL variables must have names suitable for use as Java/Scala
 * identifiers.
 * <p>
 * The layer namespace is used only for its layer.
 * All DFDL variables defined in that namespace are either used to pass parameters to the
 * layer code, or receive results (such as a checksum) back from the layer code.
 * This is enforced.
 * If a layer namespace contains a DFDL variable and there is no corresponding
 * usage of that variable name in the layer code (following the conventions below), then
 * it is a Schema Definition Error when the layer code is loaded.
 * <p>
 * A layer that does not define any DFDL variables does
 * not have to define a DFDL schema that defines the layer's target
 * namespace, but any layer that uses DFDL variables *must* define a
 * schema with the layer's namespace as its target namespace, and with the
 * variables declared in it (using {@code dfdl:defineVariable}).
 * </p>
 * Every DFDL Variable in the layer's target namespace is used either at the start of the
 * layer algorithm as a parameter to the layer or at the end of the layer algorithm where it is
 * assigned a return value (such as a checksum or flag) from the layer.
 * <p>
 * Variables being read must have values before being read by the layer, and this is true for both
 * parsing and unparsing.
 * This happens when the Daffodil processor begins parsing/unparsing the layered sequence.
 * When unparsing, variables being read cannot be forward-referencing to parts
 * of the DFDL infoset that have not yet been unparsed.
 * <p>
 * A layer that wants to read parameters declares a special setter named
 * {@code setLayerVariableParameters}
 * which has arguments where each has a name and type that match a corresponding
 * {@code dfdl:defineVariable} in the layer's target namespace.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the layer logic has a DFDL variable for a parameter named {@code direction}
 * of type {@code xs:string} and another DFDL variable for a parameter named {@code wordCount}
 * of type {@code xs:unsignedShort}
 * then the derived Layer class must have a {@code setLayerVariableParameters} with
 * arguments corresponding in name and type to these two variables.
 * This setter will be called passing the value of the variables immediately after the layer
 * instance is constructed.
 * The arguments to {@code setLayerVariableParameters} can be in any order:
 * <pre>
 *     void setLayerVariableParameters(String direction, int wordCount) {
 *         // usually this setter will assign the values to data members
 *         this.direction = direction;
 *         this.wordCount = wordCount;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * Beside initializing local members, this setter is also an initializer for the layer class instance.
 * Any exception thrown becomes a Schema Definition Error.
 * <p>
 * If there are no parameter variables, then this setter, with no arguments, can be used purely for initialization.
 * <p>
 * A DFDL variable used to return a result from a layer must be undefined, since variables in DFDL are single-assignment.
 * Usually this means the use of the layer must be surrounded by a {@code dfdl:newVariableInstance}
 * annotation which creates a new instance of the layer result variable, over a limited scope
 * of use.
 * The variable is assigned by the layer, and it is then available for reading by the DFDL schema until
 * the end of the {@code dfdl:newVariableInstance} scope.
 * <p>
 * To return a value into a DFDL variable, the layer implementation defines a special recognizable
 * getter method.
 * The name of the getter is formed from prefixing the DFDL variable name with the string
 * "{@code getLayerVariableResult_}".
 * The return type of the getter must correspond to the type of the variable.
 * <p>
 * For example, a result value getter for a DFDL variable named {@code total} of type {@code xs:unsignedShort} would be:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *      int getLayerVariableResult_total() {
 *          // returns the value created by the layer's algorithm.
 *          // commonly this returns the value of a data member.
 *          return this.total;
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Layers could have multiple result variables, but a single variable is most common, generally for returning checksums.
 * See the {@link ChecksumLayer} class, which is designed to facilitate creation of checksum/CRC/hash/digest layers.
 * <p>
 * The Java types to use for the setter arguments and getter return types correspond to the DFDL variable types
 * according to this table:

 * <p>
 * <h2>Layer Algorithm</h2>
 * <p>
 * The rest of the Layer class implements the layer decode/encode logic.
 * <p>
 * The actual algorithm of the layer is not implemented in methods of the derived layer class, but rather is
 * implemented in the layer's <i>input decoder</i> and <i>output encoder</i>.
 * These extend the {@code java.io.InputStream} and {@code java.io.OutputStream} base classes to actually handle the
 * data.
 * <p>
 * Every layer must implement the {@code wrapLayerInput} and {@code wrapLayerOutput}
 * methods, which provide the input decoder and output encoder instances to the Daffodil layer framework.
 * When parsing/unparsing, the derived Layer class itself is concerned with setup and tear-down of the
 * layer's input decoder and output encoder, with providing access to/from DFDL variables,
 * and with reporting errors effectively.
 * <p>
 * <h3> Layer Exception Handling </h3>
 * The method {@code setProcessingErrorException } allows the layer to specify that if the layer throws specific
 * exceptions or runtime exceptions that they are converted into processing errors.
 * This eliminates most need for layer code to contain try-catches.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *     setProcessingErrorException(IOException.class);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * informs the DFDL processor that an IOException thrown from the layer is to be treated as a processing error.
 * <p>
 * Unhandled exceptions thrown by the layer code are treated as fatal errors.
