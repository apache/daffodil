  The above xsi:schemaLocation is incorrect on purpose. This is for verification that DAFFODIL-2340 is fixed.
  A message about not being able to find the incorrect/path/on/purpose/tdml.xsd will be displayed.

  Note: this isn't a TDML test case validation error, because it's not daffodil validating parsed data against a schema
  it's the TDML runner validating this file against the schema for TDML.
