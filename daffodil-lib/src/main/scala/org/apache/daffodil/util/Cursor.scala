/**
 * Cursor pattern is a performance hack to avoid allocation of objects
 * purely due to an API constraint.
 *
 * Cursor[A] is an alternative to Iterator[T]. In Iterator[T] the next() method
 * (and peek() also) must construct an object of type T in order to return it.
 *
 * Cursor avoids this, by instead modifying an "accessor object" to contain the
 * next content (or peeked content).
 *
 * So you advance the cursor, access data using the accessor, and no allocation
 * is required by the API.
 *
 * The danger is that accessors are stateful, and must be per-thread.
 *
 * Contrast this with a callback-style API: the distinct fields of the accessor
 * would be passed as arguments to the callback method, so as to avoid
 * having to allocate an object of type T, but as there is no state object
 * being modified, a callback mechanism is always thread-safe.
 *
 * But the pattern of control it imposes is very troublesome. A cursor, like
 * an Iterator, is a "pull" style interface. It just doesn't pull new
 * objects, rather a pull operation causes a pre-existing state object to
 * be updated.
 *
 * So the accessor state objects must be thread-local, or part of some per-thread
 * state block.
