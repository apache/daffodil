/**
 * ThrowsSDE has *only* termination semantics. I.e., SDE just throws. This
 * makes it independent of context, i.e., we don't have to pass or otherwise
 * arrange for things that throw SDE to use the right compile-time or
 * runtime context to do their SDE throwing. Rather, we use the appropriate
 * compile-time or runtime mechanism for dealing with these thrown SDEs at the
 * place where they are caught. I.e., the context is on the catch-side
 * only.
 *
 * This turns out to be important for avoiding big modularity problems where
 * everything would end up parameterized by what kind of context is to be used in case
 * there is some sort of error. That makes it very hard to share code across
 * compile time (when errors are accumulated into lists) vs runtime (when SDEs
 * are usually fatal)
 *
 * Both true "compilation" i.e., SchemaComponent will mix this in, as well as
 * runtime data structures.
