/**
 * Our modified XML loader.
 *
 * The saga of the XML Loaders in scala - it's a long story. Xerces is java code.
 * It seems to be hopelessly broken in how it handles CDATA regions. It loses line
 * information in them. Push comes to shove if an XML element contains syntax where
 * line endings play a role. In DFDL, regular expressions that use the free-form comment
 * syntax need the line-endings to be preserved. Xerces always loses them, so the line
 * endings get lost and a free-form regex with a comment is hopelessly broken.
 *
 * Xerces doesn't preserve CDATA and create PCData nodes. Rather, it creates ordinary
 * Text nodes. Nor does it give you any way to get control so
 * that you can handle CDATA properly.  Hence, we use Xerces to validate XML files
 * against XML Schemas, and that includes to validate DFDL schemas against the
 * XML Schema for DFDL schemas. We also use it to validate DFDL schemas as XML Schemas
 * since that checks many things more than just validity checking does.  And we use
 * Xerces for "full validation" of the Infoset results from DFDL parsing, by converting
 * them to XML and validating them as XML against the DFDL Schema (in that case being
 * interpreted only as an XML Schema).
 *
 * A second issue: some DFDL schemas are created programatically from other files such
 * as TDML files. It would be great if we could redirect Xerces to use file/line/col
 * information from the TDML files instead of its own. But this has proven to be
 * fragile and depends on much undocumented behavior, so was removed. One might get
 * it to work for xml.load(...), but there's also the XSD validation of the schema,
 * and there we have even less visibility to the parsing of the schema.
 *
 * Back to the CDATA issue: Unfortunately, in order to actually get the XML nodes we need for TDML or DFDL
 * schemas where CDATA regions may be present, we can't use Xerces. So Daffodil has its
 * own DaffodilConstructingLoader which uses the scala.xml.ConstructingParser
 * for XML which does deal with CDATA regions properly. Daffodil extends
 * the Scala library constructing parser so as to capture the file/line/col
 * information needed for diagnostic messages.
 *
 * The DaffodilXMLLoader also resolves xmlns URIs using an XML Catalog which
 * can be extended to include user-defined catalogs. By way of a
 * CatalogManger.properties file anywhere on the classpath.
 *
 * It adds the diagnostic file, line number, column number information
 * to the nodes unless such info is already present.
 *
 * The DaffodilConstructingLoader doesn't do any resolving of its own (it does not
 * do any validation either), however, once Daffodil starts processing the
 * DFDL schema nodes, it resolves references using the same one true XML catalog resolver.
